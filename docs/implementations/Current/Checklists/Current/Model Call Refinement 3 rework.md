# Model Call Refinement 3: system instructions, output artifacts, and convergent final stages. 

## Problem Statement
- Stage prompts are not optimized for their expected utility. 
- The Parenthesis and Paralysis stages branch, instead of staying coherent. 
- The application does not provide a System Instructions prompt to ensure models provide desired documents. 
- Documents generated are not fully aligned to project needs & FAANG/startup documentation quality or ordering 

## Objectives
- Convergent logic for final stages 
- Optimized stage prompts
- System Instructions detailing stage specific output artifacts 
- Formatting requirements for iteratable implementation plans 
    - High level milestones -> intermediate signposting / sprints -> low level checklist steps 
    - Phases & Milestones at the beginning, then is interpolated with signposts & sprints. 
    - At each iteration another signpost / sprint section is filled in with prompt checklists for implementation
    - This is iterated until the full project is complete
- Github integration for exporting plans to projects 
- Site builder integration for beginning projects 
-- Bolt.new
-- Lovable.dev
-- v0
-- Replit

## Expected Outcome
- Stage prompts emulate a FAANG style production process optimized for startups / small teams / solo coders
- System Instructions explains to agent how to build artifacts for the stage
- Artifacts can be reprocessed for next iteration/phase 
- Users can sync their plans to their repo
- Users can immediately launch a project using the plans 


## Instructions for Agent
*   You MUST read the file every time you need to touch it. YOU CAN NOT RELY ON YOUR "MEMORY" of having read a file at some point previously. YOU MUST READ THE FILE FROM DISK EVERY TIME! 
*   You MUST read the file BEFORE YOU TRY TO EDIT IT. Your edit WILL NOT APPLY if you do not read the file. 
*   To edit a file, READ the file so you have its state. EDIT the file precisely, ONLY changing EXACTLY what needs modified and nothing else. Then READ the file to ensure the change applied. 
*   DO NOT rewrite files or refactor functions unless explicitly instructed to. 
*   DO NOT write to a file you aren't explicitly instructed to edit. 
*   We use strict explicit typing everywhere, always. 
    * There are only two exceptions: 
        * We cannot strictly type Supabase clients
        * When we test graceful error handling, we often need to pass in malformed objects that must be typecast to pass linting to permit testing of improperly shaped objects. 
*   We only edit a SINGLE FILE at a time. We NEVER edit multiple files in one turn.
*   We do EXACTLY what the instruction in the checklist step says without exception.
*   If we cannot perform the step as described or make a discovery, we explain the problem or discovery and HALT! We DO NOT CONTINUE after we encounter a problem or a discovery.
*   We DO NOT CONTINUE if we encounter a problem or make a discovery. We explain the problem or discovery then halt for user input. 
*   If our discovery is that more files need to be edited, instead of editing a file, we generate a proposal for a checklist of instructions to insert into the work plan that explains everything required to update the codebase so that the invalid step can be resolved. 
*   DO NOT RUMINATE ON HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OR DISCOVERY WHILE ONLY EDITING ONE FILE! That is a DISCOVERY that requires that you EXPLAIN your discovery, PROPOSE a solution, and HALT! 
*   We always use test-driven-development. 
    *   We write a RED test that we expect to fail to prove the flaw or incomplete code. 
        *   A RED test is written to the INTENDED SUCCESS STATE so that it is NOT edited again. Do NOT refer to "RED: x condition now, y condition later", which forces the test to be edited after the GREEN step. Do NOT title the test to include any reference to RED/GREEN. Tests are stateless. 
        *   We implement the edit to a SINGLE FILE to enable the GREEN state.
        *   We run the test again and prove it passes. We DO NOT edit the test unless we discover the test is itself flawed. 
*   EVERY EDIT is performed using TDD. We DO NOT EDIT ANY FILE WITHOUT A TEST. 
    *   Documents, types, and interfaces cannot be tested, so are exempt. 
*   Every edit is documented in the checklist of instructions that describe the required edits. 
*   Whenever we discover an edit must be made that is not documented in the checklist of instructions, we EXPLAIN the discovery, PROPOSE an insertion into the instruction set that describes the required work, and HALT. 
    *   We build dependency ordered instructions so that the dependencies are built, tested, and working before the consumers of the dependency. 
*   We use dependency injection for EVERY FILE. 
*   We build adapters and interfaces for EVERY FUNCTION.  
*   We edit files from the lowest dependency on the tree up to the top so that our tests can be run at every step.
*   We PROVE tests pass before we move to the next file. We NEVER proceed without explicit demonstration that the tests pass. 
*   The tests PROVE the functional gap, PROVE the flaw in the function, and prevent regression by ensuring that any changes MUST comply with the proof. 
*   Our process to edit a file is: 
    *   READ the instruction for the step, and read every file referenced by the instruction or step, or implicit by the instruction or step (like types and interfaces).
    *   ANALYZE the difference between the state of the file and the state described by the instructions in the step.
    *   EXPLAIN how the file must be edited to transform it from its current state into the state described by the instructions in the step. 
    *   PROPOSE an edit to the file that will accomplish the transformation while preserving strict explicit typing. 
    *   LINT! After editing the file, run your linter and fix all linter errors that are fixable within that single file. 
    *   HALT! After editing ONE file and ensuring it passes linting, HALT! DO NOT CONTINUE! 
*   The agent NEVER runs tests. 
*   The agent uses ITS OWN TOOLS. 
*   The agent DOES NOT USE THE USER'S TERMINAL. 

## Legend

*   `[ ]` 1. Unstarted work step. Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference. We begin with 1.
    *   `[ ]` 1.a. Work steps will be nested as shown. Substeps use characters, as is typical with legal documents.
        *   `[ ]` 1. a. i. Nesting can be as deep as logically required, using roman numerals, according to standard legal document numbering processes.
*   `[‚úÖ]` Represents a completed step or nested set.
*   `[üöß]` Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set.
*   `[‚è∏Ô∏è]` Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking or further clarification.
*   `[‚ùì]` Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing.
*   `[üö´]` Represents a blocked, halted, or stopped step or has an unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing.

[‚úÖ] 5. [TEST-UNIT] Add Export button on the session page
    [‚úÖ] a. Files:
        [‚úÖ] i. `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/SessionContributionsDisplayCard.test.tsx`
            - Assert Export button is present for any session view (always available).
    [‚úÖ] b. [UI] Add `ExportProjectButton` to session UI
        [‚úÖ] i. File: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/SessionContributionsDisplayCard.tsx` (or `DialecticSessionDetails.tsx` header)
            - Render `<ExportProjectButton projectId={currentProjectDetail.id} />` whenever a project is active.
    [‚úÖ] c. [COMMIT] feat(ui): add ExportProjectButton to session page header

[‚úÖ] 6. [TEST-UNIT] Replace ‚ÄúSubmit Responses‚Äù with ‚ÄúExport Project‚Äù at Implementation end
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/SessionContributionsDisplayCard.test.tsx`

    [‚úÖ] c. [COMMIT] feat(ui): swap submit for export at final (paralysis) stage

[‚úÖ] 7. [TEST-UNIT] Strengthen backend export TDD around FileManager integration
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Assert `uploadAndRegisterFile` is called once with `fileType: project_export_zip` and `originalFileName` set (derives from project name).
        [‚úÖ] ii. On upload failure, verify error code `EXPORT_FM_UPLOAD_FAILED` and message ‚ÄúFailed to store project export file using FileManager.‚Äù
        [‚úÖ] iii. On success, assert `createSignedUrlForPath` uses `fileRecord.storage_bucket` and the `storage_path/file_name`.

[‚úÖ] 8. [BE] Export robustness and error clarity (single file)
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. No functional change if tests pass; otherwise:
            - Add explicit log for missing `SB_CONTENT_STORAGE_BUCKET` caught via `FileManagerService` throw (already throws). Ensure fmError.details propagate into `details`.
            - Keep `FileType.ProjectExportZip` and current UploadContext; do not alter file tree ownership (remains with `file_manager.ts`).
    [‚úÖ] b. [COMMIT] fix(be): clearer error propagation for exportProject upload failures

[‚úÖ] 9. [TEST-INT] Frontend download handoff
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `packages/api/src/dialectic.api.integration.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Assert `exportProject` posts `{ action: 'exportProject', payload: { projectId } }` and returns `{ export_url }`.
    [‚úÖ] b. File: `packages/store/src/dialecticStore.integration.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Assert store sets loading/error states and returns `{ export_url }` to the component.
    [‚úÖ] c. [COMMIT] test(int): API/store integration for export and URL handoff

[‚úÖ] 10. [UI] Optional: user feedback on export completion
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `ExportProjectButton.tsx`
        [‚úÖ] i. After triggering download, show a ‚ÄúExport started‚Äù toast; handle `exportProjectError` in store and show a failure toast.

[‚úÖ] 11. [TEST-UNIT] Prove FileManager registration bug for project export
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.upload.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Add a test for `FileType.ProjectExportZip` where storage upload succeeds but `dialectic_project_resources.insert` returns a PostgREST-style error (include `code` and `details`).
        [‚úÖ] ii. Assert `uploadAndRegisterFile` returns `{ record: null, error }` with `error.message === 'Database registration failed after successful upload.'` and `error.details` containing the DB `code/details`.
        [‚úÖ] iii. Assert cleanup attempts to remove the uploaded file (verify `storage.remove` called with the uploaded path).

[‚úÖ] 12. [BE] Fix FileManager registration for project export JSON and error propagation
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Persist `resource_description` as a JSON object (not a string) for `dialectic_project_resources` rows; include `{ type: 'project_export_zip', originalDescription? }` (or merged parsed JSON when provided).
        [‚úÖ] ii. Improve error propagation: when insert fails, include PostgREST `details`/`code` in `error.details`.
    [‚úÖ] b. [COMMIT] fix(be): FileManager export registration JSON + clearer DB error details

[‚úÖ] 13. [TEST-UNIT] Validate happy path for project export registration
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.upload.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Add/extend a passing test for `project_export_zip` asserting:
            - Insert payload uses `storage_path/file_name` from `constructStoragePath`.
            - `resource_description` includes `{ type: 'project_export_zip', ... }` as JSON (not string).
            - Returns `{ record }` without error.

[ ] 14. [TEST-INT] Backend integration: exportProject ‚Üî FileManager
    [ ] a. File: `supabase/integration_tests/services/export_project.integration.test.ts`
        [ ] i. Re-run with real functions: assert `{ export_url }` returned and a `.zip` resource exists for the project (latest rows), no 500 error.
    [ ] b. [COMMIT] test(int): export integration succeeds with FileManager registration

[‚úÖ] 15. [TEST-INT] RED: prove unique-constraint collision at project root
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/integration_tests/services/export_project.integration.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Add a test that first registers `initial_user_prompt` at project root, then attempts to export the project (export stored at project root per `@file_manager.md`).
        [‚úÖ] ii. Assert current behavior returns a 500 from `exportProject` with details indicating a unique constraint on `(storage_bucket, storage_path)`.
        [‚úÖ] iii. This documents the real user error observed in manual testing.

[‚úÖ] 16. [TEST-UNIT] RED: define desired overwrite semantics and deterministic export filename
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Assert that the export filename is deterministic: `project_export_{slug}.zip` (no timestamp), stored at the project root path.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Assert FileManager is invoked such that storage upload uses `upsert: true` and DB registration performs an upsert on conflict keys so repeated exports overwrite the same record.
        [‚úÖ] iii. This will fail until code and schema changes are made.

[‚úÖ] 17. [DB-MIGRATION] Update uniqueness to allow multiple files at the same root path
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/migrations/*_dialectic_project_resources_unique_path_fix.sql`
        [‚úÖ] i. Drop existing unique constraint/index on `(storage_bucket, storage_path)` for `public.dialectic_project_resources`.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Create a new unique index/constraint on `(storage_bucket, storage_path, file_name)` to allow multiple files under the same directory.
        [‚úÖ] iii. Include a safe IF EXISTS check for dropping and name the new constraint consistently (e.g., `unique_bucket_path_file_name`).

[‚úÖ] 18. [BE] Implement overwrite behavior for exports at project root
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Generate `originalFileName` as `project_export_{slug}.zip` (no timestamp) so the export is a single, stable artifact per project.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Ensure `FileManagerService` is called with that filename and description `{ type: 'project_export_zip', ... }`.
    [‚úÖ] b. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. For `fileType: 'project_export_zip'`, use DB `upsert` (not `insert`) with `onConflict: ['storage_bucket','storage_path','file_name']` so the record is overwritten if it already exists.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Storage upload should continue to use `upsert: true` so the zip file content is overwritten atomically.

[‚úÖ] 19. [TEST-INT] GREEN: export coexists with initial prompt at root and overwrites on repeat
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/integration_tests/services/export_project.integration.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Re-run the step-15 scenario; assert success (200), and both `initial_user_prompt` and `project_export_zip` rows exist for the project.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Call `exportProject` twice; assert only one `project_export_zip` row remains (or that the same row is updated), and storage reflects the latest content.

[ ] 20. [DOCS] Align file tree and uniqueness policy
    [ ] a. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.md`
        [ ] i. Confirm documentation reflects exports stored at project root and uniqueness by `(bucket, path, file_name)` with overwrite behavior for deterministic export filenames.

[‚úÖ] 21. [TEST-UNIT] Export UI downloads without navigation and with correct filename
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/ExportProjectButton.test.tsx`
        [‚úÖ] i. Add a test asserting that when `export_url` is cross-origin, the component:
            - Calls `fetch(export_url)` and receives a Blob response.
            - Creates an object URL via `URL.createObjectURL` and clicks an anchor with the `download` attribute.
            - Does not call `window.location.assign` or `window.open`.
            - Calls `URL.revokeObjectURL` after triggering the click.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Add a test for filename extraction from `Content-Disposition` (supports `filename=` and RFC5987 `filename*=`) and asserts the anchor `download` name uses the decoded filename; fallback to `project_export.zip` when header is absent.
    [‚úÖ] b. [COMMIT] test(ui): ExportProjectButton uses blob/object URL; no navigation; preserves filename

[‚úÖ] 22. [UI] Implement blob/object-URL download flow in ExportProjectButton
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/ExportProjectButton.tsx`
        [‚úÖ] i. On success, `fetch` the signed `export_url`, build a `Blob`, create an object URL, and programmatically click an anchor with `rel="noopener"` and `download` set to the parsed filename or `project_export.zip`.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Revoke the object URL after the click (defer revocation to the next tick).
        [‚úÖ] iii. Do not navigate (do not set `window.location` or use `target` navigation).
    [‚úÖ] b. [COMMIT] fix(ui): export uses blob/object URL to trigger browser download UI

[‚úÖ] 23. [TEST-UNIT] Verify regression guard for navigation
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/ExportProjectButton.test.tsx`
        [‚úÖ] i. Add a test that spies on `window.location.assign` and `window.open` to assert neither is called during export.
    [‚úÖ] b. [COMMIT] test(ui): guard against navigation during export download

[‚úÖ] 24. [TEST-UNIT] exportProject propagates FileManager error.details
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. In the FileManager failure test, assert returned error includes `details` equal to the FileManager error `details` string (not undefined).
    [‚úÖ] b. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. When `uploadAndRegisterFile` fails, set `details` to `fmError?.details || fmError?.message` so the client sees specifics.
    [‚úÖ] c. [COMMIT] fix(be): upsert export resource and propagate fm error details

[‚úÖ] 25. [TEST-UNIT] FileManager upserts DB record for project_export_zip
    [‚úÖ] a. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.upload.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Add a test that when inserting a `project_export_zip` row that already exists (same `(storage_bucket, storage_path, file_name)`), the DB call performs an upsert and returns the updated record without error.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Assert storage upload uses `{ upsert: true }`.
    [‚úÖ] b. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. For `fileType: 'project_export_zip'`, use `upsert` with `onConflict: ['storage_bucket','storage_path','file_name']` for `dialectic_project_resources`.
        [‚úÖ] ii. Ensure storage upload passes `{ upsert: true }` so the blob overwrites.

[ ] 26. [TEST-INT] GREEN: export succeeds and returns URL after upsert fix
    [ ] a. File: `supabase/integration_tests/services/export_project.integration.test.ts`
        [ ] i. Re-run export with an existing export at root; assert 200, `{ export_url }` present, and only one `project_export_zip` row exists (updated).
    [ ] b. [COMMIT] test(int): export succeeds post-upsert and details propagation

[ ] 27. [TDD] Export download URL normalization (dev and prod)
    [‚úÖ] a. Problem: The signed URL may use an internal gateway host (e.g., `kong`) that browsers cannot resolve; users see network errors. Objective: Always return a browser-resolvable URL using the public Supabase base while preserving path and token.
    [‚úÖ] b. [TEST-UNIT] File: `supabase/functions/_shared/supabase_storage_utils.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Given `SUPABASE_URL` and a mocked `createSignedUrl` returning `http://kong:8000/storage/v1/object/sign/...?...`, expect `createSignedUrlForPath` to return `${SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/sign/...?...` with identical pathname/query (token unchanged).
        [‚úÖ] ii. When the returned URL already uses the public base, expect the function to return a URL with the same origin/path/query (no change in behavior).
    [‚úÖ] c. [SRC] File: `supabase/functions/_shared/supabase_storage_utils.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. After successful `createSignedUrl`, normalize: determine `publicBase = Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')`; compute `storagePublicBase = new URL('/storage/v1', publicBase)`; parse original URL and rebuild as `storagePublicBase.origin + original.pathname.replace(/^.*\/storage\/v1/, '/storage/v1') + original.search`.
    [‚úÖ] d. [TEST-INT] File: `supabase/integration_tests/services/export_project.integration.test.ts`
        [ ] i. Extend assertion to verify the `export_url` host matches the configured public base host and includes the expected `/storage/v1/object/sign/` path and token query.
    [ ] e. [COMMIT] fix(be): normalize storage signed URLs to public base to avoid internal hostnames
    [‚úÖ] f. [TEST-UNIT] API wiring uses normalized signed URL for exportProject (RED)
        [‚úÖ] i. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/index.test.ts`
            - Under `withSupabaseEnv`, set `SUPABASE_URL` to `http://localhost:54321`.
            - Mock storage `createSignedUrl` to return `http://kong:8000/storage/v1/object/sign/...?...`.
            - Call `handleRequest` with action `"exportProject"` and assert the JSON `export_url` origin equals `SUPABASE_URL` and the `/storage/v1/object/sign/...` path and token are preserved.
            - Expect failure (proves handler is not using normalized util).
    [‚úÖ] g. [SRC] Wire normalized util in API handler
        [‚úÖ] i. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/index.ts`
            - In the `"exportProject"` case, replace `createSignedUrlDefaultFn` with `createSignedUrlForPath` imported from `../_shared/supabase_storage_utils.ts`.
    [‚úÖ] h. [TEST-UNIT] GREEN: API wiring returns normalized URL
        [‚úÖ] i. Re-run 27.f test; assert it now passes with normalized origin and preserved `/storage/v1/object/sign/...` path and query.
    [‚úÖ] i. [TEST-UNIT] Normalize when SUPABASE_URL itself is internal (RED)
        [‚úÖ] i. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/supabase_storage_utils.test.ts`
            - Case A: `SUPABASE_URL = http://kong:8000`, storage returns `http://kong:8000/storage/v1/object/sign/...?...`.
              Expect `createSignedUrlForPath` ‚Üí `http://localhost:54321/storage/v1/object/sign/...?...` with identical path/query.
            - Case B: `SUPABASE_URL = http://host.docker.internal:54321`, storage returns same host.
              Expect normalized `http://localhost:54321/storage/v1/object/sign/...?...` (preserve port and query).
    [‚úÖ] j. [SRC] Implement internal‚Üílocalhost normalization (GREEN)
        [‚úÖ] i. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/supabase_storage_utils.ts`
            - If original hostname OR `SUPABASE_URL` hostname is internal (`kong`, `host.docker.internal`):
              derive `normalizedPublicBase` by swapping hostname to `localhost`, preserving port (fallback to 54321 if no port).
              Rebuild `${normalizedPublicBase}/storage/v1...` with original pathname suffix and query.
            - Otherwise, keep existing behavior.
            - Enable console diagnostics in `createSignedUrlForPath` for this test scope: log redacted original URL (`replace(/(token=)[^&]+/, '$1REDACTED')`), `SUPABASE_URL`, `original.hostname`, `publicBase.origin`, `isInternal`, and the redacted normalized URL.
    [‚úÖ] k. [TEST-INT] Verify normalized URL via API
        [‚úÖ] i. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/index.test.ts`
            - Under `withSupabaseEnv` set `SUPABASE_URL` to an internal host; mock storage to return an internal signed URL.
              Call `handleRequest("exportProject")`; assert the returned `export_url` begins with `http://localhost:54321/storage/v1/...` and query token is preserved.
            - Capture and assert presence of the storage utils/export service log lines (with token redacted) confirming: original URL host, `SUPABASE_URL`, internal-host detection, and final returned URL.
[ ] 28. [TDD] Remove filename fallback; pass exact export file name unchanged
    [‚úÖ] a. Problem: Frontend uses a default 'project_export.zip' when Content-Disposition is absent, violating no-fallbacks. Objective: Always use the exact file name returned by the backend; if missing, fail (no download).
    [‚úÖ] b. [TEST-UNIT] Backend: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.test.ts`
        [ ] i. Assert exportProject returns `{ data: { export_url, file_name } }` where `file_name` equals the DB `fileRecord.file_name` (e.g., `project_export_{slug}.zip`).
    [‚úÖ] c. [SRC] Backend: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Include `file_name: fileRecord.file_name` in the success response alongside `export_url`.
    [‚úÖ] d. [TEST-UNIT] Frontend: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/ExportProjectButton.test.tsx`
        [‚úÖ] i. Assert anchor `download` equals `response.data.file_name` exactly (no transformation).
        [‚úÖ] ii. When `file_name` is not provided, assert we show a toast error and do not trigger a download (no fallback name, no navigation).
    [‚úÖ] e. [SRC] Frontend: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/ExportProjectButton.tsx`
        [‚úÖ] i. Use `response.data.file_name` for `anchor.download`; remove the `'project_export.zip'` fallback and header-parsing logic.
        [‚úÖ] ii. If `file_name` is absent, log and toast an error; return without downloading.
        [‚úÖ] iii. [TEST-UNIT] Store: `packages/store/src/dialecticStore.test.ts`
            [‚úÖ] Assert `exportDialecticProject(projectId)` resolves with `{ status: 200, data: { export_url, file_name } }` and that `file_name` equals backend value exactly.
            [‚úÖ] When backend omits `file_name` or returns an error, assert we surface an error (no defaults) and set `exportProjectError`.
        [‚úÖ] iv. [SRC] Store: `packages/store/src/dialecticStore.ts`
            [‚úÖ] Update `exportDialecticProject` return type to `ApiResponse<{ export_url: string; file_name: string }>` and forward `file_name` unchanged from backend.
            [‚úÖ] Remove any defaults/fallbacks; do not synthesize `file_name`.
            [‚úÖ] Align types in `packages/types/src/dialectic.types.ts` for `DialecticActions.exportDialecticProject` and `DialecticApiClient.exportProject` to use `ApiResponse<{ export_url: string; file_name: string }>`.

    [‚úÖ] f. [TEST-INT] Integration: `supabase/integration_tests/services/export_project.integration.test.ts`
        [‚úÖ] i. Assert response includes both `export_url` and exact `file_name`; verify overwrite semantics remain unchanged.
    [ ] g. [COMMIT] fix(be,fe): remove filename fallback; return and use exact file_name

    [ ] c. [COMMIT] feat(store): add analytics in store actions

[ ] 6. [ADAPTER] Ensure Posthog provider mapping is up to date
    [ ] a. [TEST-UNIT] `packages/analytics/src/index.test.ts`
