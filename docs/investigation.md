# Dialectic Pipeline Integration Test Investigation

This document traces the execution of jobs in the `dialectic_pipeline.integration.test.ts` to understand the root cause of file name collisions and incorrect job counts.

## Thesis Stage Analysis

### Job A (Designed to Fail and Retry)

- **Job ID:** `d150cbc6-a898-4a0c-a457-e5bbfcc41ce3`
- **Creation:** Log line 88
- **Completion:** The job initially fails as designed, is marked for retry, and then completes successfully on the second attempt (log line 922).
- **Re-run reason:** The test is designed to simulate an error on the first run, which triggers the retry mechanism.

### Job B (Designed to Continue)

- **Job ID:** `109b4dcb-71e8-469d-bf04-de1465e6ed1d`
- **Creation:** Log line 105
- **Completion:** The initial job completes with a `max_tokens` finish reason, correctly triggering a continuation. The original job is marked as `completed` (log line 585), which is expected.
- **Continuation Job ID:** `f405aaac-a936-44f8-9470-fdf7da8940bd` (identified at log line 588)
- **Continuation Completion:** The continuation job is marked as `completed` at log line 1055.

## Antithesis Stage Analysis

The core issue in this stage appears to be twofold:
1.  Jobs that are designed to fail are incorrectly being marked as `completed`, yet are still being re-queued for a `retry` later on.
2.  The planner appears to run more than once for the same parent jobs, creating duplicate child jobs that lead to file name collisions.

### Parent Job A (`5897b572-17cc-4687-b7a9-a2b011cae31f`)

-   **Creation:** Log line 1343.
-   **Planning:** The planner initially runs at line 1370, creating two child jobs as expected.

#### Child Job A.1 (`6cffa267-f7b1-4343-a2a6-b0d5aa1fd57d`)

-   **Creation:** Log line 1370.
-   **Execution 1:**
    -   Starts at line 1384.
    -   A `SIMULATE_ERROR` is injected at line 1613.
    -   The AI call fails as expected at line 1649.
    -   A **file name collision (409 Duplicate)** occurs at line 1726.
    -   **Incorrectly marked `completed`** at line 1735 with `attempts: 1`, despite the failure.
-   **Execution 2 (Retry):**
    -   Re-appears for execution with status `retrying` at line 5002. This happens despite the job being marked `completed` previously.

#### Child Job A.2 (`8cf52cec-7193-4c5e-9dab-9c26fd2a1d9f`)

-   **Creation:** Log line 1370.
-   **Execution 1:**
    -   Starts at line 1736.
    -   A `SIMULATE_ERROR` is injected at line 1965.
    -   The AI call fails as expected at line 2001.
    -   A **file name collision (409 Duplicate)** occurs at line 2078.
    -   **Incorrectly marked `completed`** at line 2087 with `attempts: 1`, despite the failure.
-   **Execution 2 (Retry):**
    -   Re-appears for execution with status `retrying` at line 4563.

#### Child Job A.3 (Extraneous Duplicate of A.1 - `0e1316ab-d9a8-43e5-b296-70e5cf8ecfad`)

-   **Creation:** Creation is not logged by the planner. The job first appears at line 2798.
-   **Execution:**
    -   Starts at line 2798.
    -   A `SIMULATE_ERROR` is injected at line 3027.
    -   A **file name collision (409 Duplicate)** occurs at line 3148. The file path is identical to the one in Child Job A.1's first execution.
    -   Marked `completed` at line 3154.

#### Child Job A.4 (Extraneous Duplicate of A.2 - `8e1b28d1-ed28-43ec-8432-b87cdabfae32`)

-   **Creation:** Creation is not logged by the planner. The job first appears at line 3155.
-   **Execution:**
    -   Starts at line 3155.
    -   A `SIMULATE_ERROR` is injected at line 3384.
    -   A **file name collision (409 Duplicate)** occurs at line 3505. The file path is identical to the one in Child Job A.2's first execution.
    -   **Incorrectly marked `completed`** at line 3511 with `attempts: 1`.

### Parent Job B (`40f4888c-7ce4-469f-8639-f326969a607d`)

-   **Creation:** Log line 1359
-   **Planning:** The planner initially runs at line 1381, creating two child jobs as expected.

#### Child Job B.1 (`ffc9f404-8ead-4572-bcd3-742e24888687`)

-   **Creation:** Log line 1381.
-   **Execution:**
    -   Starts at line 3512.
    -   `SIMULATE_MAX_TOKENS` is injected at line 3741, which should have triggered a continuation.
    -   However, the job is marked `completed` at line 3868, not `needs_continuation`. The raw AI response shows a `finish_reason` of `stop`, indicating the simulation did not behave as expected.
    -   A **file name collision (409 Duplicate)** occurs at line 3862.

#### Child Job B.2 (`f8a079b4-4aa4-4477-99be-54d7cb73ff4f`)

-   **Creation:** Log line 1381.
-   **Execution:**
    -   Starts at line 3869.
    -   `SIMULATE_MAX_TOKENS` is injected at line 4098.
    -   The job is marked `completed` at line 4225, not `needs_continuation`. The `finish_reason` is `stop` (line 4216), so the simulation failed to trigger a continuation.
    -   A **file name collision (409 Duplicate)** occurs at line 4219.

### Extraneous Jobs

- **Job IDs:** TBD
- **Analysis:** TBD

## File Name Collision Analysis

There are 9 total "409 Duplicate" errors in the log. They are caused by multiple jobs attempting to write to the same file path. This happens for two main reasons:
1.  A job is re-run (either as a duplicate or a retry) after a failure, and it attempts to save its output to the same location as the first attempt.
2.  The `SIMULATE_ERROR` and `SIMULATE_MAX_TOKENS` test injections are not being handled correctly, leading to jobs being marked `completed` when they should be `failed` or `needs_continuation`. The subsequent duplicate/retry runs then collide with the file created by the first run.

This concludes the detailed tracing portion of the investigation.
